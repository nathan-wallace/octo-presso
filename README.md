# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

## Page Templates

This project includes several ready-made page templates in `src/lib/templates`.
You can scaffold a new route from one of these templates using the helper script:

```bash
node scripts/create-page.js <slug> <template-id>
```

For example, to create a `/pricing` page based on the `pricing` template:

```bash
node scripts/create-page.js pricing pricing
```

The script creates `src/routes/<slug>/+page.svelte` that renders the selected template component.

## Deployment

This project uses [`@sveltejs/adapter-static`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-static) and a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the built site to **GitHub Pages**. Any changes pushed to the `main` branch automatically trigger a deployment to the `gh-pages` branch.

The application is served from `/octo-presso`, so when developing locally the base path is `/` but in production it uses `/octo-presso`.
The `svelte.config.js` file now sets this automatically based on `NODE_ENV`, so no manual edits are necessary.

When deploying to **GitHub Pages**, ensure a `.nojekyll` file exists in the `docs` directory. Without this file GitHub Pages runs Jekyll, which ignores files in directories that start with an underscore (like the `_app` folder generated by SvelteKit), resulting in 404 errors for your assets.
