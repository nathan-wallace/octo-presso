# About

Welcome to our marketing site built with SvelteKit.

This example demonstrates how Markdown content can be mixed with Svelte
components to produce rich pages. You can use the `scripts/create-page.js`
helper to scaffold new routes from any of the templates under
`src/lib/templates` and then enhance them with your own Markdown or
components.

The goal is to give you a solid starting point while keeping the code
easy to understand. Explore the existing templates and feel free to
experiment by creating your own.
