# About

This sample site uses Markdown content alongside Svelte components. Here are a few example pages you might build:

- **Tree Explorer** – showcase your favorite forests and visualize how trees change through the seasons.
- **Monkey Sanctuary** – highlight primate conservation efforts with playful images and adoption stories.
- **Tibetan Buddhism Journey** – feature temple events and share teachings from Tibetan monks.

Modify these examples or create new ones to suit your own ideas.
