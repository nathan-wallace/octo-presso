# Federal Content Excellence Guidelines

This project draws inspiration from **WebFirst** and public-sector best practices, including recommendations from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Federal Website Content Excellence guidelines.

Key principles include:

- **Web-first publishing** – prioritize digital content and ensure it works across devices before producing PDFs or printed materials.
- **Accessibility** – deliver information that meets or exceeds Section 508 and WCAG standards so everyone can access your services.
- **Plain language** – write for a general audience. Avoid jargon, define acronyms on first use, and keep sentences concise.
- **Accurate and current information** – review content regularly and remove outdated pages to maintain trust with users.
- **User-centered design** – conduct usability testing and incorporate feedback to create intuitive navigation and clear calls to action.
- **Performance and analytics** – measure site performance with analytics tools and use data to inform continual improvements.

These practices align with the broader federal digital strategy and help ensure public websites are trustworthy, accessible, and easy to navigate.
